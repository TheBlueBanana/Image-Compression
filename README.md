# Image-Compression
This is a project created with the purpose of experimenting with compression and learning how to apply compression techniques by hand.
Is part of the research work I have to do in order to finish my secondary school year.
All the code is done by me so it may not be polished nor efficient. Even though I'll be improving it soon
Cheers
